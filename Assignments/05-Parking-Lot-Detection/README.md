Occupied Parking Space Project
==============================
Due: TBD

### Overview

This project will use a logistical regression technique and your choice of libary to implement a machine learning approach to identifying whether or not a parking space is occupied. The dataset can be found here: [PKLot.tar.gz](http://cs.mwsu.edu/~griffin/p-lot/pklot_images/PKLot.tar.gz). 

>This database contains 12,417 images (1280X720) captured from two different parking lots (parking1 and parking2) in sunny, >cloudy and rainy days. The first parking lot has two different capture angles (parking1a and parking 1b).
>
>The images are organised into three directories (parking1a, parking1b and parking2). Each directory contains three >subdirectories for different weather conditions (cloudy, rainy and sunny). Inside of each subdirectory the images are >organised by acquisition date.
>
>Each image of the database has a XML file associated including the coordinates of all the parking spaces and its label (occupied/vacant). By using the XML files to segment the parking space, you will be able to get around 695,900 images of  parking spaces.
